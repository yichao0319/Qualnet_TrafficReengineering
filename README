-------------------
Goal:
In hidden terminal scenario, offload/onload traffic between wifi link and cellular link to optimize throughput


-------------------
Implementation:
use 802.11a as wifi link and 802.11b as cellular link. 
Since 802.11b has larger communication range, there wonâ€™t be hidden terminal for 802.11b link. 


-------------------
Scenario:
1 (UE1) ----- 2 (BaseStation); 3 (BaseStation) ----- 4 (UE2)
flow 0: node 1 -> node 2
flow 1: node 4 -> node 3
each node has 11a and 11b interface.


-------------------
Load Offloading/Onloading Algorithm: 

stage 1 (exponential search):
    if throughput is improved 
        double 11b traffic
    else
        upper_bound = current 11b traffic 
        lower_bound = previous 11b traffic 
        enter stage 2
    end
stage 2 (binary search):
    if throughput is improved
        lower_bound = current 11b traffic
        11b traffic = (current 11b traffic + upper_bound) / 2;
    else
        upper_bound = current 11b traffic
        11b traffic = (current 11b traffic + lower_bound) / 2;
    end

run.pl
the simulator which implement the alogrith, run Qualnet, and parse the Qualent output

Qualnet read the following configure files:
- SelectLink.config
  generated from SelectLink.mother.config by run.pl
- SelectLink.app
  generated by run.pl
- SelectLink.nodes
- SelectLink.routes-static

I use the following configure to test Qulnet configuration works ok
- SelectLink.test.config
- SelectLink.test.app
